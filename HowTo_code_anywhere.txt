HOWTO for setting up a Cloud9 instance to run the CA-Tracing demo

Follow https://community.c9.io/t/running-a-python-cgi-server/1602
This includes:
$ sudo a2enmod cgi
$ sudo systemctl restart apache2

You need to edit 

$  sudo emacs /etc/apache2/conf-available/serve-cgi-bin.conf

And change the defintions of ScriptAlias & Directory to refer to:

  /home/cabox/workspace/curve-experiments/crvtrak/cgi-bin
  
You also need to add the following in the 
last <IfDefine ENABLE_USR_LIB_CGI_BIN> clause:
   AddHandler cgi-script .cgi .py

Python scripts are in cgi-bin to facilitate running on servers that
don't like cgi scripts mixed with HTML

Also, use
$ service apache2 restart
When mods are made to CGI scripts

$ sudo apt-get install python-opencv
$ sudo ln /dev/null /dev/raw1394  # Disables camera API

The second line avoids an error message upon "import cv2",
but you can just ignore the error.
